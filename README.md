# reservations

This project is being developed by Jhonny Keller

The purpose of this project is to create a perfect automatic reservation web app to allow every restaurant owner to have access to it.

<-------------------What do I mean by automatic? ------------------------>

With full automatic I mean that the tables to each customer is automatically chosen by the
app based on the customer preference and the restaurant availability respecting the current
schedule and the expected time that the customer will stay.
The challenge behind it, was making the app working with any type of restaurant.


<------------------- When will the app be finished ------------------------>

Hopefully in the next few months I would say March 2023.
